    question: "What is PEOCHAIN?",
    answer: "PEOCHAIN is an advanced blockchain architecture designed to overcome fundamental limitations of existing blockchain networks. With innovative subnetting, layer-2 scaling solutions, and our proprietary consensus mechanism, PEOCHAIN delivers enterprise-grade performance (100,000+ TPS) with uncompromising security and decentralization."
  },
  {
    question: "What core blockchain problems does PEOCHAIN solve?",
    answer: "PEOCHAIN solves scalability, security, and decentralization issues simultaneously using advanced techniques like subnetting, PoSyg, and Zero-Knowledge proofs. Our architecture breaks through the 'blockchain trilemma' that has constrained other platforms."
  },
  {
    question: "How does PoSyg improve over traditional consensus algorithms?",
    answer: "PoSyg combines the efficiency of PoS with additional layers of security and decentralized consensusâ€”delivering secure validation without the centralization risks or environmental costs of older blockchain technologies. It enables high throughput while maintaining robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes PEOCHAIN different from other blockchain platforms?",
    answer: "PEOCHAIN's technical advantage comes from our innovative subnet validator network architecture, Zero-Knowledge implementation, and Proof of Synergy consensus. Together, these technologies enable 1-second finality with throughput exceeding 100,000 TPS while maintaining truly decentralized operation and military-grade security."
  },
  {
    question: "Is PEOCHAIN just for finance or broader applications?",
    answer: "While initially optimized for decentralized finance, PEOCHAIN's architecture supports numerous sectors like supply-chain, healthcare, and identity management. Our technical foundation is designed to be versatile and adaptable to any enterprise or application requiring high-performance, secure blockchain infrastructure."
  },
  {
    question: "How does PEOCHAIN handle interoperability with other blockchains?",
    answer: "PEOCHAIN implements advanced cross-chain bridges and communication protocols that enable seamless asset and data transfers between different blockchain networks. Our architecture supports both native cross-chain operations and integration with industry-standard bridge solutions, creating a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem."
