      shortDescription: "Advanced, energy-efficient consensus with decentralization incentives.",
      longDescription: "Proof of Synergy is PeoChain's revolutionary consensus mechanism that combines the security of Proof of Stake with advanced validator incentives that reward collaboration and network health rather than just stake size. PoSyg introduces a dynamic stake multiplier based on contribution to overall network performance.",
      benefits: [
        "90% lower energy consumption than traditional Proof of Work",
        "Enhanced security through collaborative validation",
        "Optimized validator incentives for maximum decentralization",
        "Dynamic stake adjustments preventing validator centralization"

      longDescription: "Dynamic Contribution Scoring continuously evaluates validator performance across multiple metrics including uptime, transaction validation accuracy, network latency, and governance participation. This creates a meritocratic validation environment where technical contribution is rewarded alongside financial stake.",
      benefits: [
        "Real-time validator performance tracking and incentivization",
        "Protection against validator collusion or monopolization",
        "Granular metrics tracking for network health optimization",
        "Meritocratic validation rewards based on actual contribution"

      longDescription: "PeoChain's subnet architecture divides transaction processing into specialized, parallel subnet validators that process transactions simultaneously. Each subnet maintains its own consensus while coordinating with the primary chain, enabling true horizontal scaling as network demand increases.",
      benefits: [
        "Unlimited theoretical TPS through horizontal scaling",
        "Specialized subnets optimized for specific transaction types",
        "Reduced validator hardware requirements for participation",
        "Predictable performance regardless of network load"

      longDescription: "PeoChain integrates zero-knowledge cryptography to enable transaction verification without revealing sensitive data. Our custom ZK-SNARK implementation allows validators to verify transaction validity without seeing transaction details, enhancing both privacy and security while reducing the data footprint on the network.",
      benefits: [
        "Private transactions with mathematical security guarantees",
        "Reduced on-chain data requirements for better scalability",
        "Protection of sensitive financial information",

      longDescription: "PeoChain's Threshold Signature Scheme distributes cryptographic signing across multiple validators, requiring a minimum threshold of participants to authorize transactions. This eliminates single points of failure and enhances security by preventing any individual validator from controlling transaction authorization.",
      benefits: [
        "Elimination of single key vulnerability points",
        "Enhanced security for high-value transactions",
        "Protection against validator compromise or attacks",
