- **Dynamic Supply Management:**  
  Employs strategic token buybacks and issuance adjustments to stabilize prices, manage volatility, and respond dynamically to market conditions, thus safeguarding economic health.

- **Participant-Centric Incentives:**  
  Validators and users earn rewards proportional to their **Synergy Scores**, incentivizing consistent participation, staking, governance involvement, and referrals, reinforced by periodic bonuses and gamified engagement mechanisms.
