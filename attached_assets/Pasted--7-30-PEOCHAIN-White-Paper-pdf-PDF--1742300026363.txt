Analyse problems and organise straightforward prompt of what has to be fixed
ChatGPT сказал:
Here's a straightforward, organized prompt clearly outlining exactly what needs to be fixed:

Prompt for Fixing Visual and Textual Overlap Issues:

Please address and resolve the following issues with overlapping text and graphical elements on the /whitepaper page for PeoChain:

1. Subnet Validator Architecture Chart:
Problem: The chart title "Subnet Validator Architecture" appears duplicated and overlaps with graphical elements.
Fix Needed:
Remove the duplicated chart title.
Ensure adequate spacing between subnet labels ("Subnet 1," "Subnet 2," etc.) and graphical subnet nodes.
Clearly differentiate labels from visual nodes for improved readability.
2. Proof of Synergy (PoSyg) & Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS) Charts:
Problem: Text beneath the charts ("Fig. 1..." and "Fig. 2...") is barely visible and overlaps with the lower border, significantly reducing readability.
Fix Needed:
Add sufficient vertical padding below each chart to clearly display figure captions without overlap.
Adjust font size and contrast to enhance visibility.
3. Tokenomics Charts (Token Distribution & Metrics):
Problem: Bar charts ("Key Token Metrics") partially cut off, affecting readability of labels and values.
Fix Needed:
Increase chart container width or apply horizontal responsiveness to accommodate all elements clearly.
Ensure labels ("Total Supply," "Circulating Supply," etc.) and numerical values are fully visible, not truncated or clipped.
4. Mobile Integration Architecture Chart:
Problem: Text labels ("Deposit," "Withdraw," "Integration," "API Access") overlap graphical connectors and become unreadable, especially in mobile views.
Fix Needed:
Reposition text labels and adjust connector lines to eliminate overlap.
Add spacing or padding to clearly separate text from connectors for improved clarity.
Ensure full readability on both desktop and mobile versions through responsive scaling.
General Guidelines:

Maintain responsiveness across desktop and mobile.
Use adaptive scaling to ensure readability at various screen sizes.
Clearly separate textual and graphical elements with sufficient spacing or padding.
Verify readability after adjustments through thorough testing on multiple device resolutions.
