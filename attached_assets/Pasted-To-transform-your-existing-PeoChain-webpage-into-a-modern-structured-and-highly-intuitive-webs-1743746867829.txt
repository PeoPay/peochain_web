To transform your existing **PeoChain** webpage into a modern, structured, and highly intuitive website (inspired by the clarity, simplicity, and structure of **bitcoin.org**), I recommend reorganizing and updating your website in the following structured way:

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **Website Structure and Content Upgrade**

### **Hero Section (Top Page)**
- **Concise Headline:** 
  - "PeoChain: The Blockchain Redefined"
- **Subtitle:** 
  - "Solving Blockchain's Trilemmaâ€”Scalability, Security, Decentralization"
- **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):**
  - **[Join the Waitlist]** and **[Explore Technology]**
- **Background:** Clean visual animation showcasing decentralized transactions or interconnected blockchains subtly in motion.

---

### **Key Problems & Solutions Section**
Clearly demonstrate problems and solutions in simple interactive flip-cards or accordion-style dropdowns.

| Problem | PeoChain Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| High Transaction Costs | **Ultra-low transaction fees:** USD 0.004 per transaction |
| Scalability & Performance Issues | **100,000 TPS with 1-second finality:** Instant transactions even at peak load |
| Complex User Experiences | **User-Centric Mobile Integration:** Seamless integration with mobile payments like M-Pesa, GCash |
| Economic Instability & Volatility | **Localized Stablecoins & Stability Mechanisms:** Reliable economic environment |

### **Technical Features Section**
Clearly highlight your innovative technologies with visual icons and short descriptions, clickable for more in-depth explanations:

- **Proof of Synergy (PoSygâ„¢)** â€“ Advanced, energy-efficient consensus with decentralization incentives.
- **Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS)** â€“ Transparent validator scoring system ensuring fairness and network resilience.
- **Subnet Validator Network** â€“ Independent subnets enabling high throughput.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs)** â€“ Ensuring privacy, security, and scalability.
- **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)** â€“ Collaborative security architecture removing single points of failure.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability** â€“ Seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchain networks.

Each technology could link to a detailed explanatory page or modal window.

---

### **Interactive Demos**
Engage users with a sophisticated interactive demo section, demonstrating:

- **Cross-chain interoperability** â€“ Visualize transaction flow.
- **Subnet Validator Parallel Processing** â€“ Demonstrate performance differences against traditional chains.
- **Real-time Blockchain Statistics** â€“ Show TPS, network validators, and decentralization metrics.

---

### **Developer & Tester Program**
Provide dedicated early-access programs for developers:

- Clear signup form: Name, Email, Role (Developer/Tester), GitHub URL.
- Direct API documentation links.
- Early beta test invitations clearly explained.

---

### **Performance & Comparison Table**
Show concise comparison to other popular blockchains:

| Feature | PeoChain | Ethereum | Solana | Avalanche |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Consensus | PoSygâ„¢ | Proof of Stake | Proof of History | Avalanche Consensus |
| Transactions per second (TPS) | 100,000 | 15-30 | 65,000 | 4,500 |
| Finality | 1 sec | 12-15 min | 400 ms | 2-3 sec |
| Fees | Ultra-low fixed | Variable Gas | Low fixed | Medium fixed |

### **Economic Sustainability Section (Tokenomics)**
Provide clear graphical token distribution:

- Active Validators: 30%
- Ecosystem Growth: 25%
- Team Commitment: 15%
- Stabilization Fund: 15%
- Liquidity: 10%
- Community Adoption: 5%

Clearly describe stability mechanisms:
- Token buybacks, staking incentives, algorithmic adjustments, and economic reserves.
