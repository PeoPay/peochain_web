Our Technology  
PeoChain is a blockchain platform built for speed, security, and scalability, aiming to promote global financial inclusion.  
Key Features  
Consensus Mechanism  
PeoChain uses Proof of Synergy (PoSyg), a hybrid consensus system that combines the energy efficiency of Proof of Stake (PoS) with the strong security of Proof of Work (PoW). This ensures a secure network while keeping energy use low.  
Scalability  
PeoChain can process up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) with 1-second finality, making it one of the fastest blockchain platforms. This makes it ideal for microtransactions and widespread adoption.  
Mobile Money Integration  
PeoChain connects with platforms like M-Pesa and GCash, giving users in emerging markets access to decentralized financial services without needing a traditional bank account.  
Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS)  
Our Dynamic Contribution Scoring system rewards users for supporting the network—whether by staking or participating in governance—building an active, community-driven ecosystem.  
System Architecture  
PeoChain’s architecture is designed to be modular, secure, and high-performing, offering a solid base for decentralized financial applications.  
Consensus Layer (PoSyg + DCS)  
Proof of Synergy (PoSyg): Balances energy efficiency and network security.  
Dynamic Contribution Scoring (DCS): Rewards users for contributing to the network.  
Handles validator management and reward distribution.  
EVM Compatibility Layer  
Supports smart contracts and state management.  
Optimized for low-cost transactions.  
Cross-Chain Bridge  
Enables secure asset transfers and state synchronization between blockchains.  
Includes advanced security for smooth interoperability.  
PeoPay API Layer  
REST API endpoints for easier development.  
Mobile integration for better user experience.  
Real-time transaction processing.  
PoSyg + DCS: Key Highlights  
Synergy Scoring  
Validators earn points by reliably proposing blocks and participating in governance, encouraging consistent contributions.  
Security Features  
Synergy-weighted voting strengthens the network against attacks like Sybil and 51% attacks, ensuring resilience.  
High Performance  
With 1-second finality and the ability to process up to 100,000 TPS, PeoChain is optimized for high-demand applications and mass adoption.  
These features make PeoChain a leader in blockchain innovation, accessibility, and performance, designed to meet the financial needs of underserved communities worldwide.
